# people-and-cultures-through-history
Recently I met a set of people who were born and brought up in cultures that favor Western style
thought, getting exposed to Eastern ideologies and thoughts rethinking theirselves and leaning in
more towards eastern styles of thought

Similarly, I have observed people from the culture in which I was born and raised, leaning in towards
Western philosophy. I think I have been observing this pattern- as a scoiety grows modern, the rise
of a hipster crowd that embraces the other faction of the world

It would be interesting to study these groups- Europians, Australians and Americans(Invaders) favouring
Eastern ways of thought and Asians- Indians, Chineese, Japaneese and Koreans learning about Sartre, Camus
and Neitzsche

I believe that there has been an inert time period in development of Eastern philosophies. I am not 
talking about the absence of preachers, I mean the absense of ground breaking ideas. The renaissance in
Europe, the years of exploration of ideas of existantial crisis. I feel such a thing is missing in Eastern
culture

Why does this happen, (if my assumption is true). What is going to happen in the future as the world is
turning into a very very small place

Think of the evolution of the ideas of love and romance. How it got transformed in the span of centuries.
Think of the evolution of the idea of 'induvidual', the 'ego', how it is reflected up on in various cultures.
Think of the evolution of the idea of 'freedom', the salvery to modern corporate blue collors
