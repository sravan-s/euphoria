Think about it, the people living in my country, most of them, aren't having proper options to
explore the world. They donot have proper anything that most of the developed countries enjoys
these days. I donot want them to dwell in luxury. Actually a country like India getting luxurious
is a huge catastrophie. Still, if a person from Korea could easilly travek to other countries- they
have the economic freedom and their passport is very friendly. If a middle class boy from India
wants to go anywhere, he simply cannot. He doesn't have enought money, his passport is shitty, I
feel jealous of people here. The experience is something that matters and my home society is clearly 
lacking that. Everyone open their eyes, learn more about how world works, maybe not... Maybe not!!!
