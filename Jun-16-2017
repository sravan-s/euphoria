We are waiting for that next thing. After one ambition is fullfilled, the next popups.
What's the point of accepting this and living on? What's the alternative?

“I'm no more modern than ancient, no more French than Chinese, and the idea of a native country,
that is to say, the imperative to live on one bit of ground marked red or blue on the map and to hate
the other bits in green or black, has always seemed to me narrow-minded, blinkeredand profoundly stupid.
I am a soul brother to everything that lives, to the giraffe and to the crocodile as much as to man.”
- Gustave Flaubert
