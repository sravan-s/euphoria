The pyramid of needs

I think this only applies to individualistic people

Maybe for more advanced human being, one should always push items from self actualization into
esteem. As time flows, the items that populate the pyramid changes, this can be more clearly visible
on the higher levers. On the lower levels, ie- physiologic needs would always be there, untill he is
alive(think of a scenario where a person transcends the need for fullfilling his physiologic needs)
