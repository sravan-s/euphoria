The pyramid of needs

I think this only applies to individualistic people

Maybe for more advanced human being, one should always push items from self actualization into
esteem. As time flows, the items that populate the pyramid changes, this can be more clearly visible
on the higher levers. On the lower levels, ie- physiologic needs would always be there, untill he is
alive(think of a scenario where a person transcends the need for fullfilling his physiologic needs)

I have seen the same idea in some other places too. In spiritual ideologies, where, they say, once
you have seen acquired all that you wanted, you can move to real sainthood and to the higher order
of existence

The crave for primal desires will rocket up to sky level when self doubt over powers common sense.
But basically one can use it for his personal growth, may be that's what he mean by finding and taming
one's innear daemons
